    Frequently Asked Questions:

    ## Q: Why can't I find a specific affliction/item?
    A: This guide is incomplete at the current moment. This guide is a copy of Trello guide, by 28.03.2023

    ## Q: What is the difference between Symptoms and other afflictions?
    A: Symptoms are afflictions that don't do anything on their own, and merely exist to make diagnosis easier, while other afflictions have effects that actually impact gameplay.

    ## Q: Button not work/Link to item missing
    A: If something not working, or have unexpected behaviour, send bug report into steam mod page, with steps to reproduce.

  <Manual_Description_Med_Kit_Recommendations>
    ###First aid kit
    Distribute these to crew or around the sub

    @bandages
    @sutures
    @tourniquet
    @autopulse - only used to keep yourself conscious till reaching a doctor
    @blood-packs - Preferably O- or O+
    @gypsum
    @trauma-shears
    @opium to use with a @wrench on dislocations (or dislocation pills)
    (minor husk sepsis pills)

    It can't be placed in a med kit, but a @wrench is used for dislocations, which are common

    ###Doctor's med kit 1
    @opium, @morphine, or your choice of @analgesia pills for surgery
    @bandages
    @sutures - fits in surgery toolbox instead if you carry one
    @tourniquet
    @health-scanner
    @hematology-analyzer
    @blood-packs - Preferably O- or O+
    @gypsum
    @trauma-shears - fits in surgery toolbox instead if you carry one

    This first med kit will cover the most basic diagnosis and treatments, but a second med kit and/or surgery kit provides most of the tools for more serious treatments.

    Also recommended to keep a stasis bag in your hotbar

    ###Doctor's med kit 2
    @surgical-drill
    @surgical-saw
    @ambubag
    @antiseptic-sprayer with @antiseptic loaded or @antibiotic-ointment
    @manual-defibrillator or @aed
    @mannitol (or neurotrauma pills)
    @broad-spectrum-antibiotics (or minor husk sepsis pills)
    calyxanide (or major husk pills)
    @plastiseal or @antibiotic-glue

    ###Surgery kit
    @scalpel
    @hemostat
    @retractors
    @sutures
    @tweezers
    @needle
    @drainage
    The 4 most used @organ-procurement-scalpels or extra @needle and @drainage

    Consider adding a @needle to your med kit if you don't carry around a surgery kit regularly
  </Manual_Description_Med_Kit_Recommendations>

  <Manual_Description_How_To_Diagnose>
    Diagnosing is used to describe the process of using the "Three H's":
    - Health Interface - Provides things that are mostly surface level
    - Health Scanner - Provides information about the internals
    - Hematology Analyzer - Provides information about the blood

    Using this method gives you the most information and makes it much easier to properly treat your patient and increase their chances of survival.
  </Manual_Description_How_To_Diagnose>

  <Manual_Description_Order_of_Treatments>
    #If the patient is in immediate danger of dying put them in a @stasis-bag
    A stasis bag will give you 6 minutes of paused afflictions to diagnose, figure out your treatment plan, and administer any treatments short of surgery.

    ###Suggested treatments in order of importance
    1. Put them in stasis bag if they're in rapidly deteriorating condition
    2. Diagnose problems and figure out which steps from below are relevant
    3. @tourniquet any @arterial-bleeding
    4. If there's major regular bleeding, @sutures them, give @blood-packs if necessary and continue doing so in further steps if necessary. If they have internal or aortic bleeding, that will need to be fixed before transfusing blood or you will waste blood bags. Consider using liquid oxygenite further down to stabilize the patient for those surgeries.
    5. Use a @needle if @pneumothorax is high
    6. If in @stasis-bag, prep patient for removal from bag, give any drugs if they need it
    \- @azathioprine: if they need later organ transplants
    \- Antirad or stabilozine: radiation sickness IMPORTANT
    \- @broad-spectrum-antibiotics: sepsis
    \- @mannitol: neurotrama reduction or healing if their blood is stable
    \- @morphine: painkiller for surgery
    \- @thiamine: organ damage healing
    Then take them out of the stasis bag to start surgery (here's where you apply @liquid-oxygenite if you're going to after using a stasis bag)
    7. First aid for heartbeat/breathing if they're arrested or about to arrest (or if just taken out of stasis bag, as that arrests heartbeat and breathing). Skip this step if they have massive internal or aortic bleeding to fix first.
    8. Fix @aortic-rupture, @internal-bleeding, and @arterial-bleeding properly. Give more blood if needed.
    9. Properly fix any heart/breathing problems, including using @drainage to fix @pneumothorax
    10. Fix bad @burns (high second degree or any third degree)
    \- Second degree: @antibiotic-ointment or @bandages if that limb doesn't need surgery
    \- Third degree: @antibiotic-glue, or if that limb needs surgery, wait till the end of surgery and use @plastiseal before the closing @sutures.
    11. Do @osteosynthesis-implants surgeries on head/neck/chest @fractures and then @spinal-cord-implants surgery on @spinal-cord-injury
    12. @health-scanner body parts and perform @tweezers surgery to remove @foreign-bodies as well as heal @internal-damage and blunt force trauma
    13. @organ-transplant-surgery surgery if needed.
    14. Apply @sutures to close surgeries to fix @wounds
    15. @bandages then @gypsum any @fractures on arms or legs to cast them
    16. Use @hematology-analyzer to check if they have any lingering blood problems and administer @broad-spectrum-antibiotics if they have @sepsis if you didn't give it to them earlier

    An additional option is @liquid-oxygenite if they're having @neurotrauma and/or having massive bleeding problems. It negates all need for breathing, heartbeat, and having any blood for 30 seconds. LO2 gives you some time to fix @arterial-bleeding or @aortic-rupture properly while not accruing damage for 30 seconds. It will cause some organ damage though.

    You can also choose to use @liquid-oxygenite to outright ignore bleeding, breathing, and heartbeat problems for 30 seconds while you do surgery, then apply @blood-packs and restart heartbeat/breathing after fixing problems with surgery. If they have an @aortic-rupture it might be a good idea to use LO2 and ignore the massive blood loss and replace the blood after fixing the aortic rupture and any other serious bleeding.

  <Manual_Description_Fibrillation>
    Fibrillation is a 3-step process. At first, it will begin as increased heartrate, which will increase slowly. Upon reaching 100% increased heartrate, it will become irregular heartbeat, which will also increase, and will become cardiac arrest upon hitting 100%. Additionally, there is a chance for irregular heartbeat to immediately skip to cardiac arrest, which scales depending on how much irregular heartrate you have. Fibrillation gain is halved when under the effects of @adrenaline.

  <Manual_Description_Traumatic_Amputation>
    Traumatic amputation is the non-surgical amputation of an extremity. A traumatic amputation will act the exact same as a @surgical-amputation, besides from the fact that you will acquire @arterial-bleeding upon first getting amputated. A limb must be fractured in order to become traumatically amputated.

    ---

    ##Caused by:
    - Trauma (gunshots, internal damage, blunt force, lacerations, bite wounds and explosions)
    - @material-loss (99% or more)

    ###On application:
    - Fully treats @heart-attack and @hemotransfusion-shock
  </Manual_Description_Streptokinase>

  <Manual_Description_Surgery_Table>
    The Surgery Table is an item that can be bought from a station or crafted and then placed down. The patient is not required to be on the table, they only need to be near it. The Surgery Table provides artificial ventilation to everyone near the table and prevents @traumatic-shock provided the patient is under @analgesia. Additionally, the table will decrease Oxygen Low and prevent @respiratory-arrest from increasing @acidosis.

    The table also has wiring pins that can be used to output important information, such as blood pressure, @neurotrauma, heart rate, and breathing rate.

    It should be noted that the Surgery Table is functionally identical to a Hospital Bed. The other beds prevent Traumatic Shock if you're laying on them, but they do not provide artificial ventilation.
  </Manual_Description_Surgery_Table>

  <Manual_Description_Surgical_Drill>
    ### Medical skill check: 45

    The fifth step in @osteosynthetic-surgery.

    ### Application success:

    Successfully using the surgical drill will give the patient @drilled-bones on the limb the tool was used on.

    ### Application failure:

    +15% bleeding
    +10% @internal-damage
  </Manual_Description_Surgical_Drill>

  <Manual_Description_Surgical_Saw>
    ### Medical skill check: 45

    The fifth step in @amputation-surgery.

    ### Application success:

    Successfully using the surgical saw will give the patient @sawed-bones on the limb the tool was used on.

    ### Application failure:

    +15% bleeding
    +6% @internal-damage
    +4% lacerations
  </Manual_Description_Surgical_Saw>

  <Manual_Description_Sutures>
    ### Medical skill check: 30

    The final step in all surgical procedures. Also very useful for curing most @wounds  bleeding.

    ### Application success:

    Removes all surgery related afflictions (such as @surgery-incision
    -20% gunshot wounds
    -20% lacerations
    -20% bite wounds
    -20% deep tissue injuries
    -40% bleeding

    ### Application failure:

    +6% @internal-damage
  </Manual_Description_Sutures>

  <Manual_Description_Thiamine>
    ### Medical skill check: 10

    A container of vitamin B1 pills used to assist in organ healing.

    ### Application success:

    200 seconds of organ healing time

    ### Application failure:

    120 seconds of organ healing time

    ‌

    200 seconds of organ healing time will heal around 8% organ damage (excluding @neurotrauma, and 120 seconds will heal 4.8%. This is in addition to natural organ healing at the same time. Thiamine cannot revive dead organs.
  </Manual_Description_Thiamine>

  <Manual_Description_Tourniquet>
    ###Medical skill check: 30
    An item used to restrict the blood flow to a specific limb to lessen regular and arterial bleeding.
    The tourniquet will not work without @arterial-bleeding. Can be cut off using @trauma-shears.

    ###Application success:
    Temporarily stops the negative effects of arterial bleeding, and slowly treats regular bleeding, but will cause @gangrene if kept on for an extended period of time. Using a tourniquet on the head will give the victim 15% @neurotrauma and 200% oxygen low.


    ###Application failure:
    +6% blunt force trauma
  </Manual_Description_Tourniquet>

  <Manual_Description_Trauma_Shears>
    ###Medical skill check: 10
    A pair of scissors used to remove plaster casts and @bandages.

    ###Application success:
    Removes all plaster casts, bandages, and triage cards on the limb the shears were used on.

    ###Application failure:
    +15% bleeding
    +10% lacerations
  </Manual_Description_Trauma_Shears>

  <Manual_Description_Tweezers>
    ###Medical skill check: 30
    A pair of tweezers used to remove damaged tissue or bullets.

    ###Application success:
    -5% @internal-damage
    -5% blunt force trauma
    -5% @foreign-bodies
    +5% lacerations

    ###Application failure:
    +6% @internal-damage

    The tweezers can work without @retracted-skin if the limb you are tweezing has gunshot wounds or deep tissue injuries, using the tweezer through gunshot wounds or deep tissue injuries will cause 5% @traumatic-shock. Tweezing out foreign bodies also has a 5% chance to yield scrap.
  </Manual_Description_Tweezers>

  <Manual_Description_Wrench>
    ###Medical skill check: 60 (30 if the patient has @analgesia)
    The wrench is used to treat @dislocations. To treat dislocations, drag it onto the dislocated limb in the health interface and use it as a treatment, like you would a bandage.

    ###Application success:
    Cures dislocation on that limb

    ###Application failure:
    Causes a fracture on that limb
  </Manual_Description_Wrench>

  <Manual_Description_Traumatic_Shock>
    Traumatic shock is very fatal, and should your patient acquire this at any point, immediately terminate the surgery, bring them back into the proximity of a @surgery-table or administer sedation again. Traumatic shock will decrease in strength 4x as fast provided the victim is under the effects of @anesthesia or has @analgesia while being near a @surgery-table.

    ---
    ##Caused by:

    - Performing unsafe surgery (without a table or without sedation)
    - Using @tweezers through gunshot wounds or deep tissue injuries (causes very minor shock, can usually be ignored)

    ##Effects:

    - @hypotension (and lots of it)
    - @cardiac-arrest (at 40% or more)
    - @respiratory-arrest (at 30% or more)
    - @neurotrauma (equal to strength divided by 100 per second, 10% or more is the point at which it outpaces natural regeneration)
    - Psychosis (equal to strength divided by 100 per second)

    ##Treatments:

    - Terminating the surgery and waiting
    - Bringing into proximity of a @surgery-table and making sure the patient is sedated

    ##Prevention:

    - Making sure that the surgery is safe before proceeding beyond the @retracted-skin step
    - Making sure @analgesia doesnt run out in the middle of surgery
  </Manual_Description_Traumatic_Shock>

  <Manual_Description_Surgery_Incision>
    The second step in all surgical procedures. Having an unclamped surgical incision will cause 0.7% @blood-loss per second for each incision, and having a surgical incision without @analgesia or another sedation method  will cause 2% @traumatic-shock per second for each incision. This affliction will not cause traumatic shock if done without a @surgery-table, therefore making it save to bloodlet without one.
  </Manual_Description_Surgery_Incision>

  <Manual_Description_Clamped_Bleeding>
    The third step in most surgical procedures. Having clamped bleeding will prevent @blood-loss caused by @surgery-incision. This affliction is required for the next step, the @retractors
  </Manual_Description_Clamped_Bleeding>

  <Manual_Description_Retracted_Skin>
    The fourth step in most surgical procedures. Having retracted skin without a @surgery-table nearby will cause 2% @traumatic-shock per second for each instance of retracted skin. Most surgical procedures, such as @osteosynthetic-surgery or @organ-transplant-surgery stem off from this step.
  </Manual_Description_Retracted_Skin>

  <Manual_Description_Drilled_Bones>
    The fifth step in @osteosynthetic-surgery. Having drilled bones without a @surgery-table nearby will cause 1.5% @traumatic-shock per second for each instance of drilled bones.
  </Manual_Description_Drilled_Bones>

  <Manual_Description_Sawed_Bones>
    The fifth step in @amputation-surgery. Having sawed bones without a @surgery-table nearby will cause 1.5% @traumatic-shock per second for each instance of sawed bones.

    8. Cybernetic limbs, (not bionic implants), can be placed on the limb if surgically amputated. Surgery does not need to be open to attach cyberlimbs. (Optional) (Requires NT Cybernetics addon)

    Doing this procedure will not yield the limb if the limb has more than 15% @gangrene

    This procedure causes @surgical-amputation)
  </Manual_Description_Amputation_Surgery>

  <Manual_Description_Organ_Transplant_Surgery>
    Make sure to use @azathioprine before placing the organ in, and make sure their immunity is 10% or lower. If organ damage is 100% after placing it in, that means it got rejected. This does not apply if organ rejection is turned off in the config.

    ##Steps:

    1. Anesthetic of your choice
    2. @scalpel
    3. @hemostat
    4. @retractors

  </Manual_Description_Surgeon_Clothes>

  <Manual_Description_Surgical_Infection>
    Surgical Infection is a mechanic that causes @sepsis based on how sterile the patient's environment is.

    ---

    The following will _increase_ sterility:

    - Patient wearing @surgical-drapes
    - Nearby characters wearing @surgical-mask
    - Having surgery skill (sterility gained based off this equation: 10 + surgery skill / 5)
    - Having @ointmented

    ---

    The following will _decrease_ sterility:

    - Patient having no @surgical-drapes
    - Nearby characters not wearing @surgical-mask

    ---

    At the minimum sterility, there is a 10% chance every two seconds for the patient to acquire @sepsis.
  </Manual_Description_Surgical_Infection>

  <Manual_Description_Mannitol_Plus>
    Mannitol Plus is a talent item, meaning it requires a talent to craft. Upon being administered, it will treat 30% @neurotrauma over the course of 10 seconds even if the patient is unstable and apply @mannitol's effects without causing @liver-damage / @lung-damage / @heart-damage / @kidney-damage / Organ Damage
  </Manual_Description_Mannitol_Plus>

  <Manual_Description_Experimental_Treatment>
    Experimental Treatment is a talent item unlockable by the Surgeon class. It can randomly give effects both negative and positive, though it tends to give positive effects more than negative ones.
    Theres a theoretical chance to get infinite effects from one use of this item. Imagine flipping a coin, and only stopping when you get tails. Every time you get heads, you get an additional effect from this item.

    The list of possible positive effects are as follows:

    ---
    - Vigor (randomly picks from 200-400% strength)
    - Hyperactivity (randomly picks from 200-400% strength)
    - Psychosis Resistance (randomly picks from 200-400% strength)

    - @ointmented (randomly picks from 20-100% strength)
    - Combat Stimulant (randomly picks from 30-100% strength)
    - Pressure Stabilized (randomly picks from 30-100% strength)
    - A full heal (treats 20-100% of @wounds, vanilla organ damage, @neurotrauma and @blood-loss, and fully cures @sepsis)

    ---

    The list of possible negative effects are as follows:

    ---
    - Any @wounds (randomly picks from 30-80% for bleeding, picks from 5-20% for everything else)
    - Stuns for 2-15 seconds
  </Manual_Description_Experimental_Treatment>

  <Manual_Description_Triage_Card>
    Triage Cards are used to mark patients based on severity of injury. There are two types of triage cards, those being manual and automatic. The manual triage card works as follows:

    Attaching the triage card to the legs will mark it as green, meaning that the patient is minimally injured and will most likely survive.
    Attaching the triage card to the arms will mark it as yellow, meaning that the patient is injured, and will most likely die if treatment is delayed for a long period of time.
    Attaching the triage card to the torso will mark it as red, meaning that the patient is critically injured and needs immediate assistance.
    Attaching the triage card to the head will mark it as black, meaning that the patient is either dead or extremely close to death.

    The automatic triage cards will rate your victim's health based off of their afflictions and vitality, and will give a rating of green, yellow, red or black.
  </Manual_Description_Triage_Card>

  <Manual_Description_Brain_Jar>
    The Brain Jar is a talent item unlockable by the Surgeon. Unlike refrigerated containers, which can only delay the decay of a brain and not entirely stop it, the Brain Jar can not only hold a brain indefinitely, but will slowly repair the brain at a rate of 1% per 10 seconds.
  </Manual_Description_Brain_Jar>

  <Manual_Description_Artificial_Brain>
    Replaces a patients brain when used after removing it. Protects against gaining neurotrauma from not having a brain. Does nothing else.

  <Manual_Description_Cybernetic_Arm>
    A cybernetic arm that can be attached to any surgically amputated arm socket. Can be removed with a crowbar. This results in traumatic amputation on the selected limb.

    ### Advantages of cyberlimbs:

    - Great at taking sustained gunfire without malfunctioning.
    - Excellent at tanking attacks from creatures without malfunctioning or breaking.
    - Ideal at sustaining attacks that would otherwise cause life-threatening bleeding.
    - When well maintained, is much less likely to be forcefully amputated when attacked.
    - Does not fracture or dislocate. Make sure you fix any dislocations or fractures BEFORE you add a cyber limb or else it will be permanent until you take off the limb.

    #### Disadvantages of cyberlimbs:

    - They do not mix well with water. Won’t shock you, but will break  overtime if you don’t wear a suit.
    - Requires maintenance if damaged.
    - Costly maintenance, especially if your sub doesn’t have an ample source of steel and FPGA circuits.
    - Costly/expensive to make/buy.
    - Violently detach if critically damaged through material loss.

    ### Mechanical skill requirement: 70

    ### Application Success:

    Applies the cyberlimb on the selected limb and heals any internal damage caused by any previous failed attempts.

    ### Application Failure:

    Applies 20% @internal-damage on the limb. Does not delete the cyberlimb.

    ### How to add:
    First do amputation surgery on the selected limb, then use the cyberlimb on the chosen limb.
