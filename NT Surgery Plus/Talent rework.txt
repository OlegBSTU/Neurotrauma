Barotrauma Talents by echo__seven
review in progress by -Heelge-

Primary talents in other (vanilla) classes:

- Total of four needed to advance to trees with usually better/specialised talents
- Additional EXP gain based on mission type or other factors (Captain, Security, Assistant)
- Additional skill gain (All)
- Bonus to skill not frequenttly used by class (Captain, Security)
- Debuff resistance (Captain, Security, Medical Doctor)
- One-time rewards (Captain, Engineer)
- Minor additional movement speed (Security)
- Recipes for semi useful items (Almost all)
- Books to help self or others gain skill when doing one's job (Security)
- Fabricate at higher quality (Security)
- Gain item on round end (Medical Doctor)
- More damage with commonly used tools (Engineer, Mechanic)

Trees:

Generally start with minor buffs that get more significant as you go down the tree
- High Morale -> Excellent Morale (Captain)
- Commendations -> Medals (Captain)
- Less dual wield penalty -> No dual wield penalty (Captain)
- Boarding Axe -> double damage = 1-hit KO with Axe (Security)
- Riot Shield -> Can't die for a short while (Security)
- 10% more damage -> 50% more damage (Security)
- the list goes on

More useful skills are deeper down the tree or mutually exclusive
- See previous list for former
- Big skill boost for close teammates vs small skill boost for all (Captain)
- Earn more marks with specific faction vs flat marks gain with (potentially) every faction (Captain)
- More swimming speed vs less damage taken (Security)
- the list goes on

Movement speed bonuses generally minor or tied to conditions and temporary
Movement Speed
- 5%/10%, only for others (Captain)
- 10% (Security)
- 20% while aiming (Security)
- 40% while crewmember unconscious (Medical Doctor)
- 25% while wearing Exosuit (Mechanic)
- 10% while wearing clown suit -> no to barely any resistances (Assistant)
Swimming Speed
- 50% if sub flooded (Captain)
- 25% while missing out on 20% damage reduction (Security)
- 50% while in wrecks (Mechanic)
- 50% while wearing clown suit -> no to barely any resistances (Assistant)

Current Surgeon issues (imo):

- Tree access after two talent points invested in base skills -yeah thats an issue-
- Dragging at full speed **plus** extra movement speed -> both their own talents in other classes (Medical Doctor & Security)
- Bonus EXP essentially for free **plus** recipe for semi useful item -> both their own talents in other classes and EXP talent tied to conditions not met every round by default
- Chance of finding additional items in primary talents -> lags server like crazy every time it triggers (not modder's fault, just thought I'd mention it) + is a tree talent & has less proc chance for Security and Mechanic. I also don't see why a surgeon would find extra alien items. Medical containers are already covered by Security talent and could thus proc multiple times.
- Gain Mechanical/Electrical on Surgery/Medical + doubled skill gain if respective skill at 100 -> Old talent from Captain, removed for being a little too broken. Double effect here (two skills instead of just one) makes it even worse.
- Genetic Material -> Skill from other class, not Surgeon's concern
- Patients heal faster **plus** a whopping 30% more EXP on no death **plus** a skill book to help self or others gain skill -> three talents in one, 30% bonus EXP is a lot for something somewhat easily achievable plus other EXP bonus already present
- Organs sell at high price -> Can easily be exploited (is hella fun tho)
- 20% extra health as tree talent -> underwhelming, others have it as primary talent (Security, Medical Doctor)
- 50% psychosis resistance as final tree talent -> kinda meh compared to what other classes get
- 40% hecking percent swimming speed just like that **PLUS** 25% more movement speed -> **absolutely** blown out of proportion if compared to what other classes get, also two talents in one
- 25% resistance to common damage types -> other classes get 5% - 10% flat (Captain, Mechanic in wrecks, Assistant with clown power) or higher with conditions: 20% if nobody around (Captain), 25% if attacked and only 4 seconds (Security), 20% if below 50% health (Mechanic)
- Preventative Permit feels more like a final tree talent
- Preventative Permit mutually exclusive with other powerful talent. Good and bad
